# Readscheme.org wget mirror

In 2019 there was a Reddit thread on `r/scheme`,
["What happened to readscheme.org ?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/comments/b8j7i3/what_happened_to_readschemeorg/).

In that thread `esgarth` advised, "It looks like the actual server is
still up and running."

To access the website you can add the following to `/etc/hosts` (all
together on one line as space-separated fields).
